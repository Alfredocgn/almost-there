## Business Model

Executive summary:

Almost There is a Base miniApp game based on a 24-hour, on-chain treasure-hunt where players place paid guesses on a city-themed grid. Every bet will be part of the final prize pool to be earned to the user or users that place the nearest bet to the treasure.

The city theme grid will allow people to connect to their roots or favorites places, contributing to culture.

**Why now:** 

On-chain games with verifiable payout logic + low fees on L2s. City/artist

**Problem:** 

Web3 games often feel abstract; lotteries are opaque; local culture is missing.

**Opportunity:** 

A **simple, verifiable lottery-like game** with city nostalgia + daily cadence + creator economy (artists/businesses on maps) provides repeat engagement and new revenue lines + community functions to impulse the mini app.

**Game Design:** 

Daily map with 256 available bet places or coordinates →Game starts, encrypt the random treasure position and writes its hash on the blockchain → Player selects up to **50** points→ Pays fee per coordinate→ The total amount paid goes to the pool prize  →  When the user submits its bet, a transaction with all the chosen coordinates encrypted and the wallet id are written in the blockchain → After 24 game finished → Contract calculate which wallet or wallets placed bets nearest to the treasure position and select the winner or winners→ Prize distributed equitably to wallets→ Write on the blockchain of the key to decrypt the treasure position to verify the fairness of the game.

**Market Size:** 

Base has 1.5M approx DAAs (Daily active users) ([thedefiant.io](https://thedefiant.io/news/defi/base-eyes-usd100b-in-assets-and-25m-users-on-chain-in-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com))and taking into consideration that the USDC dominance on base stablecoin is around 60% ([cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/base-stablecoin-transaction-volume-briefly-tops-all-other-chains?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) we can estimate that our DAAs with USDC present in their wallets it’s around 900k daily users. 

Being cautious we can estimate that 10% of those daily users use Base App Social Media platform. Which led us to an universe of 90.000 daily users that will be exposed to visualize Almost There miniApp.

Estimating that 0.1% of the universe of users present on Base App social media platform result on approx 90 potential daily initially.

**Game Economics:**  

- Every coordinate point is charged 0.1 USDC.
- The total amount collected by the bets of the users goes to the pool prize.
- The winner or winners get 95% of the pool prize.
- The owner of the game gets 5% of the pool prize.
- Premium function to show places of other users bet - to be paid directly to the owner at 1 USDC.

**Roadmap:**

- Development of other premium functions:
    - Hot zones - allow the user see the zones with more bets placed by other users at 0.3 USDC.
    - Package Bet - Allow the user to put a bet with a 3x3 range around the coordinate selected at 0.5 USDC.
    - Parallel games creation by the community.
- Development of community interaction through map creation by artists. Every artist will get a fee for the map once get’s played.
- Allow real life business to advertise them inside the map by putting their business as relevant and identifiable place inside the map.

**Financial Projection - 1 year window:**

- Estimated DAU Growth of 6168% from 90 users to approx 6000.
- Estimated transaction per month approx 183.000
- Estimated month revenue approx 20.328 USDC
